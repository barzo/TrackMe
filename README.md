TrackMe
=======

Tracks the location of your mobile device.

This is a PhoneGap application that allows you to determine how frequently your location is recorded, and how frequently the track you are recording is sent to a server so that people with permission are able to monitor your movement.

In addition, should you enable it, the phone will raise an alarm by sending a SMS text message to your emergency contact if the phone remains stationary for more than a configured amount of time. You will have a specified amount of time to cancel this emergency message before it is sent so you don't create panic is you decide to have a snooze. :)

Please provide ideas by creating issues, or solutions via pull requests. Thank you!

Be safe wherever you go.
